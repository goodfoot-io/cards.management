<blocker-contract>

Before creating or reusing a prerequisite work item to defer current work, recording or retaining blocked state, or reporting a blocked terminal outcome, prove every condition:

- **Causal** — prevents the outcome, not just one approach.
- **Current** — current source, task state, instructions, dependencies, and external state prove it.
- **Non-overridable** — no later user instruction supplies authority or handling direction.
- **Independently irreparable** — exhaust reasonable authorized repairs, isolation, evidence-driven retries, re-planning, and reassignment. Cheap remedies alone are insufficient.
- **Externally owned or separately scoped** — resumption requires a named external action or distinct prerequisite deliverable that cannot be completed within the current scope.
- **Actionable** — record the predicate, evidence, attempted remedies and results, why remaining plausible remedies are unavailable, unblock owner, and exact resumption condition.

Otherwise preserve unrelated state and continue recovery. Repair tools, dependencies, artifacts, services, conflicts, and baseline failures; never weaken required checks. Retry only with a new hypothesis. An error label, pending infrastructure state, or failed first strategy proves no blocker.

Reuse an existing prerequisite item after proof. Never file an item for an issue this work fixes; record the fix in the current work's state. Other items need no blocker proof; filing never authorizes stopping.

Relations require a named unfinished deliverable to constitute dependencies. Worker-local `BLOCKED` is scheduling evidence; reconcile it at the orchestrator. `STOP`, `needs_review`, questions, and approval waits are not blockers.
